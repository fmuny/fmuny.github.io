Simplified block cross-validation for time series in R
======
This reposiory introduces a simple cross-validation scheme for time series data in `R` which I developed as part of a term project in a class on Computational Statistics. The procedure extends the `createTimeSlices` function from the `caret` package (Kuhn et al., 2008), which allows to manually supply indices for the construction of the cross-validation samples.
